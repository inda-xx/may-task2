# Indamon, I choose you!

For the second exercise of INDA, you are going to practice on modelling objects in Java. You are going to acquaint yourself with the components of a Java class.

## New Task Generation

We have implemented an automated task generation system. Follow these steps to generate a new task:

1. **Go to the Actions Tab:**
   Navigate to the **Actions** tab in this GitHub repository.

2. **Select Generate Task Workflow:**
   Select the **Generate Task** workflow from the list.

3. **Run Workflow:**
   - Click the **Run workflow** button.
   - Fill in the `template` and `requirements` fields. For example:
     - **Template:** `Modeling objects in Java with getters, setters, and constructors.`
     - **Requirements:** `{"difficulty": "medium", "language": "Python", "additional_requirements": ["Include a method to serialize the object to JSON.", "Implement unit tests for each method."]}`
   - Click **Run workflow**.

4. **Review New Branch:**
   - After the workflow completes, a new branch containing the generated task will be created in the repository.
   - Review the new task in the `tasks/new_task.md` file and merge the branch into the main branch.
