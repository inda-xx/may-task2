Create a few basic tests:
  
Test Case 1: Test Player Movement 

```java
void testPlayerMovement() {
    Game game = new Game();
    // implement code to test player movement
}
```
Test Case 2: Test Scoring System 

```java
void testScoringSystem() {
    Game game = new Game();
    // implement code to test scoring system
}
```
Test Case 3: Test Enemy Interactions 

```java
void testEnemyInteractions() {
    Game game = new Game();
    // implement code to test enemy interactions
}
```
