```java
public class GameAppTest{
 // your test methods go here
}
```
Implement test cases to ensure all parts of your Class work as expected. Pay special attention to common edge cases. An example of such could be the following: what happens when the player tries to move to a cell occupied by an enemy? 

Your test class should ensure classes are properly initialized and behave expectedly with valid and invalid inputs e.g., a player never moves diagonally, a collision succeeds when a player "steps" on an enemy, adds the correct amount of points, and respects the boundary of a player's health.
