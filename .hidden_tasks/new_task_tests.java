Besides the task implementation you should also create test classes to make sure everything is working as expected.

Don't forget to take advantage of the code given as it can be very helpful. You may also use it as a starting point for your code structure. Good luck!

### Template

```java
// Enemy class
class Enemy {

    // All the enemy fields, even private ones!

    // All the enemy methods!
}

// Player class
class Player {

    // All the player fields, even private ones!

    // All the player methods!
}

class Game {
    
    // put your fields here

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Game setup code
    }

}
```
