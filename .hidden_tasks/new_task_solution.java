The solution to this task should create instances of the `Player`, `Coin` and `Enemy`, and implement all the necessary methods as outlined in the task description. The application should be able to simulate simple movement and interaction between objects.

### Template

```java
public class Player {
    // Declare instance variables

    // Implement Constructor
    // Implement Getters
    // Implement Setters
    // Implement moveUp(), moveDown(), moveRight(), moveLeft()
    // Implement collect(Coin c)
    // Implement interact(Enemy e)
}

public class Coin {
    // Declare instance variables

    // Implement Constructor
    // Implement Getters
    // Implement Setters
}

public class Enemy {
    // Declare instance variables

    // Implement Constructor
    // Implement Getters
    // Implement Setters
}

public class GameTest {
    // Implement test suits
}
```

### Existing Code

The existing code of Indamon class and tests provide a good reference for how class structure and design in terms of fields, constructor, getter and setters, as well as interaction between instances. It will be essential to adapt the logic to the new task keeping consistency with the level of depth, robustness, and quality.
