To be completed by the students. They should implement the classes `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Game` that model the rules and behaviors of the game. Also, the students should write tests to validate their designed solution.

### Existing Code

Use the code for the `Indamon` class and the `IndamonTest` class as a starting point for creating the `Player`, `Enemy`, `Game` classes, and their respective tests. The functionality, constructor methods, getters, and setters can be replicated and adapted for the needs of the new classes.
