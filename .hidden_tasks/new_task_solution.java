The solution involves creating three classes `Player`, `Enemy`, `Game`. 

The `Player` and `Enemy` classes have `name`, `hp`, and `fainted` as fields, with appropriate getters and setters. They also include methods `attack` and `hit` respectively that allow interaction between the `Player` and `Enemy` objects.

The `Game` class is for setting up and playing the game.
