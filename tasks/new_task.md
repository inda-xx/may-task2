# Programming Task: Modeling Virtual Pets in Java

## Introduction

In this task, you will model objects in Java, specifically a virtual pet. You will practice creating classes, defining attributes, and implementing methods. This exercise will help you gain a better understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and how to effectively structure your code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this task, you should be able to:

1. Design and implement classes in Java.
2. Define and utilize attributes (fields) and methods (functions).
3. Implement constructors.
4. Apply the principles of encapsulation and inheritance.
5. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your code.

## Task Requirements

### Part 1: Define a Class

1. Create a class named `VirtualPet` with the following attributes:

    - `name` (String): The name of the pet.
    - `age` (int): The age of the pet in years.
    - `health` (int): The pet's health value.
    - `mood` (int): The pet's mood level.
    - `hungry` (boolean): A flag indicating if the pet is hungry.

2. Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes.

### Part 2: Implement Methods

1. Add getter and setter methods for each attribute.
2. Implement a method `displayAttributes` to print all the information about the pet.
3. Implement a method `interact` that simulates interaction with the pet and influences mood and hunger status.

### Part 3: Unit Testing

1. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your class implementation.
2. Ensure all methods are tested, including edge cases (e.g., interacting when `mood` is at its highest).

### Part 4: Documentation

1. Add comments and docstrings to your code to explain the purpose of each class, method, and attribute.
2. Ensure that your code adheres to the style guidelines for Java.

## Submission

1. Submit your code by pushing it to your GitHub repository in the `virtual_pet` folder.
2. Ensure all unit tests pass before submission.
3. The grading will be based on the correctness, code style, efficiency, and documentation.
