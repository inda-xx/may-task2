In this task, you are required to create a Java program that adds two large numbers. The numbers are so large that you cannot add them directly. Here, the large numbers are expressed as string.

The function should take 2 string arguments and return a string result which is the sum of the numbers :

```java
public String addLargeNumbers(String num1, String num2);
```

#### Constraints

* The strings length will be between 1 and 1000.
* The strings only contain digits.
