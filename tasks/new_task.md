The third exercise of INDA is about creating a simple digital game.
The game involves a player, and an enemy. The player's goal is to defeat the enemy without sustaining too many hits. If the player or the enemy's hit points (hp) become zero, they faint and the game ends. Each hit scored decreases the hit points of either the player or the enemy by a point.

Deadline: This work should be completed before the exercise on **Friday, 30th September**.

Learning Goals:
- Modeling classes and creating objects in Java
- Using class methods for object-player interaction
- Implementing encapsulation using private fields and public getters and setters
- Using conditionals and loops in a game setting
