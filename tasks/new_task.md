In your second exercise of INDA, you will develop a small game application in Java. The objectives of this assignment involve extending the "Indamon" class from Week #2 with further functionalities. 

Your game should have the following functionalities:

- Player movement: You should extend the `Indamon`'s functionality to include the movement of Indamon in a two-dimensional grid, where the points represent the coordinates (x, y). 
- Scoring system: Implement a score to the Indamon, starting with an initial value of zero. Every movement of the Indamon should increase the score by one.
- Enemy interactions: Add an additional class called `Enemy`. When the Indamon encounters an enemy (is at the same coordinates), its `hp` should decrease by the `attack` value of the Enemy.
